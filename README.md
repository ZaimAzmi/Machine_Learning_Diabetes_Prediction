# Machine_Learning_Diabetes_Prediction

In this project, I took the lead in building a machine learning system capable of predicting whether a person has diabetes or not. The core of our implementation revolves around the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, and all the coding is done in Python.

Demonstrated the model's capability to predict diabetes status for new patients based on their medical attributes.
